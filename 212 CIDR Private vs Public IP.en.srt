1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,290
<v Instructor>So, before we go heads-on with VPC,</v>

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,860
we need to first understand CIDR,

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,380
and CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing,

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,200
but no-one says that, everyone says CIDR,

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,160
and this lecture is specific to IPv4.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,836
So, CIDR are used when you have Security Group rules

7
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:18,030
and also, in general, for AWS networking,

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,970
as we'll see in this section.

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,328
We've seen CiDRs when we started

10
00:00:21,328 --> 00:00:22,730
defining our security groups.

11
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,730
So, when we have 000/0, or 122/1, et cetera, /32,

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,010
this was actually a CIDR, but they were very specific ones.

13
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,590
So, overall, what do CIDRs do, is well,

14
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,299
they help define an IP address range.

15
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,818
So, we've seen /32 and that means one IP,

16
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:43,350
and we've seen /0, that means all IPs,

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,480
but there is in-between zero and 32, a lot of numbers,

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,480
so we can define, for example, 192.168.00/26,

19
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:55,340
which represents a range of 64 IPs,

20
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,255
from 192.168.00 to 192.168.0.63.

21
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:02,840
So, we have to see and understand

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,370
why this is the case and how this works.

23
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,960
So, to understand CIDR, we need to understand

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
that there is two components to it.

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,390
The first one is the base IP, whatever you want, and then,

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,260
there is something called the Subnet Mask, the /26 part,

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,960
and the base IP, represents an IP

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,220
that it will be contained in the range,

29
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,010
where as the subnet mask will define

30
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,349
how many bits can change in the IP.

31
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,340
So, IP, overall we see them XX.XX.XX.XX,

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,310
but actually it just zero's and ones,

33
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,430
and there are 32 of them.

34
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,960
Now, I don't wanna go into specifics of how IP works,

35
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,460
but basically the subnet mask allow a few bits

36
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,060
of the IP to change, and that will define your range.

37
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,880
Now, the Subnet Mask can take two form.

38
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,360
If you have a Windows computer,

39
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,480
maybe you'll see this, 255.255.255.0.

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,249
That's less common, or, if you use AWS online, or whatever,

41
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:55,090
you'll see more like /24,

42
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,234
which is more common and easier to read.

43
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:59,534
It's up to you though, and in this lecture,

44
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:01,660
and its whole section in AWS,

45
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,480
we'll use the more common form, /24.

46
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,490
So, let's talk about the Subnet Mask now.

47
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,610
They basically allow the underlying IP

48
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,570
to get next values from the base IP,

49
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,040
because their underlying bits change.

50
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,070
So, if you have /32, we allow for one IP,

51
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,530
and how do we get that, with 2^0.

52
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,820
If we have /31, we allow for 2 IP, because it's 2^1.

53
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,820
/30 is 4 IP, 2^2, /29 is 8 IP, 2^3, /28 is 16 IP, 2^4.

54
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,275
So, as you can see here, any time

55
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:39,390
we allow a number of bit to change,

56
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,022
it's 2 at the power of number of bit to change,

57
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:44,000
that will be added as number of IPs,

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,740
and as you see, 32 corresponds to 0, 31 corresponds to 1,

59
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,512
so, it's basically 32 minus this number,

60
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:52,745
will give us the power in here.

61
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:55,757
So, /27 is 2^5, /26, is 2^6, it's 62 IPs.

62
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,170
/25 is 2^7, 128, 256, you get the idea.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,337
Now, /16 is 2^16, which is 65,536 IP,

64
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,435
and then we'll get /0, which allows all IPs of 2^32.

65
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:17,070
So, you don't need to remember all that, obviously,

66
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,750
but you need to understand that it's 2^32, minus the number,

67
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,535
right there with the slash, and Quick memo,

68
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:26,260
/32 means no IP number can change,

69
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,160
/24 means the last IP number can change,

70
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,060
/16, the last two IP numbers can change,

71
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,210
/8, the last three, and /0, all IP numbers can change.

72
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,490
Just a quick memo.

73
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,940
But, now is just go and practice,

74
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,338
because I guess this is a new concept for some of you.

75
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:44,770
So, when we have this CIDR, what is it?

76
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,660
So, think about it, take time to reflect.

77
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,739
So, we have an IP, and we've /24.

78
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,518
What does /24 mean?

79
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:55,014
Well, that means that the last number can change, so,

80
00:03:55,014 --> 00:03:58,051
we have this range, 192.168.0.0,

81
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:02,520
all the way to 0.255, and that represents 256 IP.

82
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,140
/16, what does that mean?

83
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,810
Well, that means that the last two number can change,

84
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,176
so, we get this range, and that's 65,536 IP,

85
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:14,050
so, as you can see, the last two numbers

86
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,710
can change all the way to 255, and finally, this one.

87
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:19,543
So, what is it?

88
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:23,175
It is /32, so that means that no numbers can change,

89
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:26,330
so it's just one IP, were represented,

90
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,400
and 0.0.0.0/0, you know already, it's all IP's.

91
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,997
So, when in doubt, you can use this little website

92
00:04:31,997 --> 00:04:34,824
that I like, called ipaddressguide.com/cidr,

93
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:36,940
and we'll go, have a look at it right now.

94
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,139
So, I like this website, because it allows you to convert

95
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:43,080
a CIDR to an IP Range, or, and IP Range to a CIDR.

96
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,373
So, it's really helpful if you just know the IP range,

97
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:46,923
you know that you can't figure out the CIDR right away,

98
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:48,926
you just happen in there and then you get the CIDR.

99
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:53,926
So, let's have a look, if we do 10.0.0.0/16.

100
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,640
Well, we remember, we do allow

101
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,470
the last two numbers to change,

102
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,860
so, these two numbers should be able to change.

103
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,060
We'll calculate this, and we get

104
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,010
the subnet mask, which is right here.

105
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,680
The first IP and the last IP and the total numbers of hosts.

106
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,530
So, perfect, that's what we expected.

107
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,120
The last two numbers can change,

108
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,263
and we get 65 thousand and so IP,

109
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:16,880
and if we do /17, for something a little bit less obvious,

110
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,764
and we'll calculate it, we'll get the first IP,

111
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:23,340
and the last IP, as well as the total number of hosts.

112
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,690
So, this is really, really handy, but you know, you can do,

113
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,561
alternatively, you can refresh this page,

114
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,173
so, I'll go back to this page,

115
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,878
and what I can do, is just enter an IP range,

116
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:36,540
so, 10.0.0/0, and then, maybe this one,

117
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,620
last IP, 'cause that's the range I want,

118
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,260
and calculate my CIDR,

119
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,760
and it automatically says the result is 10.0.0/17,

120
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,000
and this is what you use in AWS,

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,190
so, really, really handy to be honest.

122
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,100
So, finally, we need to define what the difference

123
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,120
between a private and a public IP, for IPv4.

124
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,430
So, there is this internet authority, called the IANA,

125
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,220
it's for Internet Assigned Numbers Authority,

126
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,286
and they basically define that certain blocks

127
00:06:00,286 --> 00:06:02,860
of IPv4 addresses, are going to be used

128
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,771
for private purposes, and the rest is going to be public.

129
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:08,470
So, private IP's only allow certain values,

130
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,776
and it's quite easy to remember.

131
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:14,776
The first one is 10.0.0.0, all the way to 10.255.255.255,

132
00:06:15,262 --> 00:06:18,751
so, that's basically the CIDR 10.0.0.0/8,

133
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:19,584
and that's for big networks, so, that allows for

134
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,570
a lot of machines to be in that private network.

135
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,310
Then we have 172.16.0.0/12,

136
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,830
and that's the default one we get,

137
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,560
when we have a default VPC created,

138
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,920
when we create a new account,

139
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,270
and then we'll get the 192.168.0.0/16,

140
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,750
and you've seen this, I guess, before,

141
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,801
because this is what's usually used,

142
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:41,070
when you have a home network, with the WiFi and the router.

143
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,082
That's the kind of IPs we get on your internal home network.

144
00:06:44,082 --> 00:06:46,420
So, all the rest of the IPs are not

145
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,740
in this ranges, are public IP.

146
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,573
So, that's it.

147
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,231
We're ready to go on with the section on VPC,

148
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:53,047
now that we understand CIDR and private IP,

149
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:55,083
and we'll see you in the next lecture.
