1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,950
<v Instructor>Okay, so let's talk about the difference</v>

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,250
between CNAME and Alias,

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,190
'cause in the exam, that is a very common question

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,320
you may get.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,290
So Amazon resources, or AWS resources,

6
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,040
such as Load Balancer, CloudFront, et cetera,

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,300
they will expose an Amazon, AWS URL.

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,080
So for Load Balancer, it may look like this.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,080
Lb1-123.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,350
And maybe you want this to be myapp.mydomain.com.

11
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,900
So for this we'll use, Route 53.

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,870
We have two options.

13
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,070
The first one is to use a CNAME.

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,070
Remember, a CNAME makes a URL point to any other URL.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,130
So we can map app.mydomain.com to

16
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,280
blabla.anything.com.

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,700
Anything you want, right?

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,330
So CNAME though, you need to know something about it,

19
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,710
it's only for non root domain.

20
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,990
So we need it to be something.mydomain.com.

21
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,210
It cannot be just mydomain.com.

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,320
It has to be something.mydomain.com.

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,680
Very important.

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Alias now, points a URL to an AWS resource only.

25
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,427
So app.mydomain.com points to, blabla.amazonaws.com.

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,420
And it works for both root domain and non root domain.

27
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,970
So it can work for mydomain.com.

28
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,230
On top of it, Alias is free of charge,

29
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,330
and it has a support for native health checks.

30
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,580
So the example has two questions such as hey,

31
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,470
we want to point mydomain.com to our Load Balancer,

32
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,900
should you use CNAME or Alias?

33
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,500
And the answer is, you should use Alias,

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,705
because CNAME do no support root domains,

35
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,030
only for non root domains.

36
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,090
So it must be something.mydomain.com.

37
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,620
Once you get, understand this, then this is perfect.

38
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,980
Let's have a look in the hands on tool

39
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,180
to understand what I mean by this.

40
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,780
So currently I have an A record for my root domain,

41
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,730
so I'm going to delete this just for now.

42
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,840
Okay, now I'm going to create a record set.

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,210
So let me close everything, here we go.

44
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,860
I'll create a record set

45
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,067
and this is going to be myapp.stephanetheteacher.com.

46
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,440
And first choice is for me to get a CNAME.

47
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,080
And I'll make it a CNAME directly

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,110
to the load balancer I have.

49
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,100
So I scroll down, click on load balancer

50
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,410
and I'll select this GNS name right here

51
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,440
and I'll say okay, CNAME, pointing to this,

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,410
this is a very valid CNAME,

53
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,410
and it works, I'll click on create.

54
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,810
And as we can see now,

55
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,810
if I go to myapp.stephanetheteacher.com,

56
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,820
as we can see, we get the Hello World directly from

57
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,970
the load balancer which points to the EC2 instance.

58
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,440
So this is working really, really great.

59
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,530
Also what I could be doing, is instead of doing a CNAME,

60
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,750
I could use an Alias record,

61
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,220
because this is a load balancer,

62
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,770
so here I'm doing something inefficient,

63
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,680
I'm pointing directly to an amazon resources

64
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,550
but I don't take advantage of the Alias feature.

65
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,650
So I create a record,

66
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,757
I'll call it myalias

67
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,080
and there I'm going to make this an Alias record,

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,890
so click on the Alias yes,

69
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,130
and you can say, okay,

70
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,490
either you choose a target name

71
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,430
and to be honest I'm still confused by how this works

72
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,930
because sometimes it doesn't show what you wanna have.

73
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,230
Or it says you can also type the domain name

74
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,690
for the resource directly in there.

75
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,360
So if I just paste this, it will work and find right away

76
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,400
that it is my load balancer in there.

77
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,680
So I've pasted this and we get an Alias hosted zone ID

78
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,160
so this is perfect.

79
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,030
Click on create and here we go, we have an Alias record

80
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,960
being created.

81
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,050
And so if I try this URL

82
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,470
myalias.stephanetheteacher.com,

83
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,790
I get the exact same result,

84
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,940
pointing to the load balancer

85
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,240
and eu-west-1c.

86
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,960
So in that regards, my CNAME, myapp and myalias,

87
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,250
they do the exact same purpose, one is an Alias record,

88
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,960
one is a CNAME, and so this one is going to be free,

89
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,140
this one going to be paid,

90
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,130
but they achieve sort of the same purpose.

91
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,730
Overall I do recommend for you to use myalias.

92
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,310
As we can see though, in myalias,

93
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,560
we can evaluate the target health right away

94
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,820
by clicking on yes,

95
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,560
and it will directly leverage

96
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,170
the load balancer health checks for this

97
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,400
which is really, really cool.

98
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,920
But for now, just leave it as no.

99
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,930
Okay.

100
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,330
Now let's look at root domain.

101
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,460
So if I go on stephanetheteacher.com,

102
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,790
I can make this an alias and enter the target name in there,

103
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,030
and click on create and this works just fine.

104
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,750
So stephanetheteacher.com,

105
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,970
is an Alias directly to my load balancer.

106
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,610
So my root domain, is an Alias.

107
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,210
And that works just fine.

108
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,490
But if I create a record set and this time,

109
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,550
so let me just delete this one obviously first,

110
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,340
I'll delete this one, confirm.

111
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,730
So I'll make a new one,

112
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,290
stephanetheteacher.com,

113
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,480
but this one I'm gonna get a CNAME pointing to

114
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,300
and my domain name for my load balancer,

115
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,960
which is right here, pointing it and click on create.

116
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,700
Here we get an error, saying the CNAME with the DNS name

117
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,010
is not permitted at apex in zone, stephanetheteacher.com.

118
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,620
So that means that basically I'm trying to create a CNAME

119
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,177
at the root of my domain name, so at the apex of my zone

120
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,830
and that is just not allowed by Route 53.

121
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,060
So I cannot do this.

122
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,610
If I wanted to have stephanetheteacher.com

123
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,180
pointing to my load balancer,

124
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,580
CNAME is not an option, it would make an error.

125
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,190
The only way to do it would be to select an Alias record

126
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,500
and point directly to my load balancer in there.

127
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,150
Click on create, and now let's just test that out.

128
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,600
I'll go to stehanetheteacher.com,

129
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,610
and we'll have to wait just a little bit,

130
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,340
for it to work.

131
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,710
So let me just wait one second,

132
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,050
and they use an incognito window

133
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,360
just to make sure that I have no DNS cache

134
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,430
but here we go, stephanetheteacher.com,

135
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,460
points directly to my load balancer,

136
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,730
and it's replied from my EC2 instance.

137
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,740
So this is perfect,

138
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,610
that just proves that basically Alias records both work

139
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,050
for the root domain and also for sub domains.

140
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,730
Whereas, CNAME just work for sub domains only.

141
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,900
And it is something that you need to know

142
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,080
going into the exam.

143
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,990
I hope you liked this lecture,

144
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,540
I will see you in the next one.
