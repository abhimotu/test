00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,340
<v Instructor>Okay so let's talk about Route53.</v>

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,380
So Route53 is a managed DNS.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,600
And DNS stands for Domain Name System.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,940
And what's an DNS overall?

5
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,200
Well it's a collection of rules and records that will

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,870
basically help a client understand how to reach a server

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,813
through URL's.

8
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,360
So think of it as what it says it's

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,300
routing clients to final addresses.

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,670
So an AWS, you have a lot of DNS records available

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,530
but the commons that will be asked of you is going to be:

12
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,896
A which is a URL to an IPv4 IP.

13
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:34,350
AAAA which is a URL to an IPv6 type of IP.

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,230
CNAME which is mapping a URL to URL.

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,150
And Alias which is mapping a URL to an AWS resource.

16
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,718
Now we'll see CNAME versus Alias in detail in a later

17
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:46,240
lecture, but for now, remember,

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,590
there's just these most common records.

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,550
So how does a DNS work?

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,730
Well say a web browser wants to talk to an application

21
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,537
server and the application server is at this IP:

22
00:00:56,537 --> 00:00:59,390
32, 45, 67, 85.

23
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,337
What we'll do, is the first thing we'll have to do is

24
00:01:02,337 --> 00:01:03,990
to talk to Route53, and that goes on behind the scenes.

25
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,040
Doesn't mean we have to do the basically, that's how

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,530
the whole internet works.

27
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,040
So our browser will make an DNS request say for

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,985
myapp.mydomain.com and the Route53 will reply and say

29
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:17,526
by the way in my records it looks like this domain

30
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:21,450
has this IP address in A record because I send back in IP.

31
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,863
So URL to IP mapping and I send back the IP 32.45.67.85.

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,530
Okay so now my web browser has done the DNS request

33
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,330
and has gotten back an IP from it.

34
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,220
So now it knows directly to make an HTTP request directly

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,760
to the IP and it will reach the application server.

36
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,820
And it will say, by the way, the host name it asked for

37
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,800
is myapp.mydomain.com.

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,230
And then the application server will just reply with

39
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,460
HTTP response.

40
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,720
So this is how DNS works.

41
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,920
Obviously it's way more complicated but that's the

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,130
simplified version.

43
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,910
The first thing that happens is that there's an DNS

44
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,352
request and then there's an HTTP request.

45
00:01:57,352 --> 00:02:00,350
So Route53 can use different things.

46
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,750
It can use public domain name that you own or buy,

47
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,050
and then you can have whatever you want:

48
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,770
application1.mypublicdomain.com.

49
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,118
Or a private domain that can only be resolved

50
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:12,720
by your instances within your VPC.

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,500
So for example, this domain application

52
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,330
application1.company.intneral, that's not something you can

53
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,730
purchase on the internet.

54
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,727
You'll have to make this a private domain and that's

55
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:23,480
only your applications can resolve this thing.

56
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,926
Now Route53 has a lot of advanced features.

57
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:29,490
Some will be load balancing and we'll see it how that works

58
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,719
through different kind of records.

59
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,080
There will be health checks

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,660
and we'll also see this in details.

61
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,130
And then there's routing policy as we'll see on details

62
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,420
such as simple, failover, geolocation, latency, weighted,

63
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,275
and multi value.

64
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:45,207
So last thing you should know is that you are going to pay

65
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,420
$0.50 per month per hosted zone.

66
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,530
So Route53 is not something that's free.

67
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,690
There's no free tier and if you go ahead with this tutorial

68
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,360
and buy a domain name you will also have to pay for that

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,810
domain name about $12.

70
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,490
So just so you know, if you go along with me with this

71
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,940
lecture then you'll have to pay a little bit of money.

72
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,640
So that's it for the overview, we'll do a deep dive into

73
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,029
menu of these advanced features as well.

74
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:10,740
But for now let's go ahead and create a domain a domain

75
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,623
name and try out a small record.
