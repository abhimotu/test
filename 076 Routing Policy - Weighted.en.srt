1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,820
<v Instructor>So now a more interesting routing</v>

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,770
policy is called Weighted.

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,830
And Weighted controls the percentage of the requests

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,000
that will go to specific endpoints.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,630
To be concrete and visual,

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,730
we have Route 53, and we're going to assign

7
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,700
different IP addresses,

8
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,640
maybe linked to each of two instances,

9
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,140
and we're going to assign weight;

10
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,460
so 70, 20, and 10.

11
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,810
By the way, the sum does not have to be 100,

12
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,580
it's just me who chooses easy number.

13
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,930
But whatever weight you put, whatever the sum is,

14
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,330
you'll just do the average and figure out

15
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,770
a percentage from it.

16
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,040
So what we mean from this weight is that now

17
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,140
Route 53 will send 70% of the answers

18
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,020
to be back from this EC2 instance,

19
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,880
well, they will send 20% of the answer

20
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,070
back from the second one and

21
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,070
10% of the answer back to the third one.

22
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,220
What this means if that now our clients will send 70%

23
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,140
of the traffic to the first instance,

24
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,970
20% of the traffic to the second instance

25
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,570
and 10% of the traffic to the last instance.

26
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,780
So that's really helpful to start,

27
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,150
basically, assigning different weights to different parts,

28
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,180
so what we do to do this,

29
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,040
well, for example, to deploy a new application version

30
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,830
and you wanted to test only 1% of the traffic

31
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,920
on this new app version for example

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,450
then that's a nice way to do it with Route 53,

33
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,240
where it's helpful to split traffic between two regions

34
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,840
and this is super quick because you can also associate this

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,800
with health checks, so if one EC2 instance

36
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,220
is not working properly, no traffic will be sent to it.

37
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,250
So let's have a look at how this works in the console.

38
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,020
I'm going to create a new record set

39
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,991
and I'll call this one weighted,

40
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:29,970
and here I'm going to set different values,

41
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,300
so the first value I'm going to set is the one

42
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,730
from eu-west-1a which is Ireland

43
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,070
and then I'm going to say the routing policy is weighted.

44
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:39,910
Weighted, why?

45
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,900
Because we're going to be able to assign weights.

46
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,960
So we'll say this one is going to be 70

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,920
and we'll set the ID My Ireland Data Center

48
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,050
but you could set this to an arbitrarily number,

49
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,510
for example, 700.

50
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,080
So 70 is fine and here you could associate

51
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,260
with a health check, but for now we'll leave it as no.

52
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,320
Alright, we've created a weight,

53
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,380
but now thee cool thing is that we can recreate

54
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,160
another record set on the same name,

55
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,730
so weighted, that defines your dot com.

56
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,170
But now the value is going to be something else.

57
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,030
Maybe us-east-1 and I'll just paste this here

58
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,240
and here we go.

59
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,770
Now again, I will say that the routing policy is weighted,

60
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,963
and this time the weight is going to be 20,

61
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,850
and the ID is going to be US,

62
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,430
whatever you want to set really.

63
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,480
Click on create.

64
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,540
And so the cool thing we see now in the bottom

65
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,640
is that our two records, right here, are added

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,710
in two different rows and they basically

67
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,370
point to different values and at the right hand side

68
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,800
we can see the weight as a column right here.

69
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,250
And at the top right hand side,

70
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,980
we can see the ID we set to these records.

71
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,820
So finally, we can set another weight record,

72
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,300
so I'll say weighted, and the value

73
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,660
is going to be my Tokyo instance,

74
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,770
so I'll copy this IP and paste the value in, excellent.

75
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,490
And the routing policy is weighted

76
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,206
and the weight is going to be 10

77
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:03,870
and I'll call it Tokyo, excellent.

78
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,210
Click on create.

79
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,250
And now what we get out of it is three different records

80
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,790
in here that point to three different instances.

81
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,120
So now, I know you're dying to do it, let's try this URL.

82
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,870
So let's try it weighted.stephanetheteacher.com

83
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,680
and here we get an answer from us-east-1a.

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,470
And so if I refresh I'm always going to be redirected

85
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,080
to us-east-1a.

86
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,520
But when the TTL is gone, so when 300 seconds pass,

87
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,550
I did not change it to TTL,

88
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,270
so it's going to be longer to wait,

89
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,870
I will resolve to a new IP.

90
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,800
And the idea is that thanks to the weight,

91
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,420
I have 70% chance of landing on Ireland,

92
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,480
10% change of landing on Tokyo and

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,320
20% chance of landing in the US.

94
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,950
You could also take this DNS name

95
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,590
and use dig to query it and see what you get back.

96
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,810
In this case, basically what we're going to get back

97
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,010
from it is only one IP, so we're not aware that

98
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,890
there is any weight applied, we'll just get back one IP.

99
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,010
And this IP, remember, is from Ireland.

100
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,850
And so the idea here is that the Route 53

101
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,210
will serve the answers based on the weights,

102
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,010
and so from a client's side perspective,

103
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,433
we're not aware that there are multiple IPs in the backend.
