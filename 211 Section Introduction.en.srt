1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,340
<v Instructor>For networking also,</v>

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,940
we need to know in and out how to create,

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,020
operate and manage a VPC.

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,810
Troubleshooting is also very important.

5
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,513
So, we'll look at Amazon VPC

6
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:12,060
and AWS Direct Connect in this section.

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,770
Now, you may be asking me oh, I already know

8
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,740
how to do VPC and I say I hope you do

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,510
but trust me, for to know how to do a VPC,

10
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,110
you need to look at this diagram

11
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,320
and understand everything that goes in there.

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,290
So, have a good look.

13
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,300
If you know everything in there,

14
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,640
you can skip this session,

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,010
if not, I strongly recommend to do this section,

16
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,610
take your time, it is long, there's lots of learning

17
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,290
and we're going to visit a whole new set of concepts.

18
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,940
It takes a lot of time to learn VPC,

19
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,960
it took me a lot of time to learn VPC.

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,550
Don't worry, we'll go step by step

21
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,900
and understand this in our time.

22
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's get started now.
