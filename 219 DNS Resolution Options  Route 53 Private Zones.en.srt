00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,118
<v Narrator>Let's quickly talk about DNS resolution</v>

2
00:00:02,118 --> 00:00:03,318
in a VPC.

3
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:04,532
There are two very important settings

4
00:00:04,532 --> 00:00:06,498
and the exam may ask you about them.

5
00:00:06,498 --> 00:00:08,852
The first one is enableDnsSupport

6
00:00:08,852 --> 00:00:11,680
and that is a DNS resolution setting.

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,450
The default is True.

8
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,632
It helps decide if the DNS resolution

9
00:00:15,632 --> 00:00:17,626
is supported for the VPC.

10
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:20,769
That means that if it's true there is an AWS DNS server

11
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:23,342
that will be queried automatically as a primary DNS

12
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:25,259
that's 169.254.169.253.

13
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:30,318
There's second setting called enableDnsHostname which is

14
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:32,950
a DNS hostname setting as well seen in the hands on.

15
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,572
By default it's false when you create a new VPC like we did.

16
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:39,746
It's true by default when you create a default DBC.

17
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:41,628
So when it's comes with your accounts

18
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:43,592
or if you use the VPC wizard.

19
00:00:43,592 --> 00:00:45,272
It won't do anything, this setting,

20
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:48,857
unless you also have enableDnsSupport=true.

21
00:00:48,857 --> 00:00:52,038
If it's true as well then it will assign public hostname

22
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:53,838
to EC2 instances.

23
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:55,690
If it has a public IP.

24
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,359
If you use a custom DNS domain the trick is,

25
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,509
if you have a private zone in Route 53 then you

26
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:06,032
must set both these attributes to true for your instances

27
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,140
to resolve that private zone.

28
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,182
Let's have a look at this setting

29
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:11,057
and their impact right now.

30
00:01:11,057 --> 00:01:13,119
Let's go to our VPC.

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,782
We have our demo VPC right here available.

32
00:01:15,782 --> 00:01:19,196
If you right-click and we edit DNS resolution we

33
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:21,708
can see that this setting is by default enable.

34
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:25,510
This will basically resolve the AWS DNS for us.

35
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,078
This is great.

36
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:32,078
If I look at the DNS hostname, by default it is disabled.

37
00:01:32,148 --> 00:01:33,296
What happens when we enable it?

38
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:34,188
I'll show you in a second.

39
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:36,566
First let's go to EC2.

40
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:38,906
If we look at our public instance that was created

41
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:42,582
in our public Subnet, it does have an IPv4 public IP.

42
00:01:42,582 --> 00:01:45,080
It does not have a public DNS.

43
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,713
This is what this setting does.

44
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:51,153
If we do change the setting to enable and click on save.

45
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,606
DNS hostnames have been updated.

46
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:56,052
Now if you go back to our EC2 management console

47
00:01:56,052 --> 00:01:57,603
and we wait just a little bit.

48
00:01:57,603 --> 00:02:00,761
As you can see, now my instance has a public DNS

49
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:04,443
that was assigned to it automatically.

50
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:09,026
Thanks to these things now we could go into Route 53.

51
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:11,373
This is where you would be able to create

52
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:13,654
a private hosted zone.

53
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:16,332
Go to hosted zones, create zone.

54
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:18,782
Then you would make this a private hosted zone.

55
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:21,058
You have the domain of whatever you want.

56
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,558
We'll just say fubar.internal.

57
00:02:25,656 --> 00:02:27,696
It's just a random domain.

58
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:30,113
I'll call it internal domain.

59
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:33,890
Now we'll set the type as a Private Hosted Zone

60
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,719
for Amazon VPC.

61
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:38,360
It says, "To use private zones you must set

62
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,789
"the following Amazon VPC settings to true."

63
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:41,906
"Enable DNS hostname."

64
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:43,566
"Enable DNS support."

65
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:46,129
This is what we just did right here.

66
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,396
If we wanted to go with this.

67
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:50,556
We'll select the VPC ID we want to assign

68
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:51,568
this private zone to.

69
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:54,589
We'll select our demo VPC and click on create.

70
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:56,442
This will cost you $.50 if you do create

71
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,760
that zone so just be aware.

72
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,218
We created that zone fubar.internal.

73
00:03:02,218 --> 00:03:03,898
I'm going to create a record set.

74
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:07,065
I'll just call it demo.fubar.internal.

75
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:13,666
It's going to be a CNAME that points to, say, google.com.

76
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,748
Www.google.com.

77
00:03:15,748 --> 00:03:18,846
Just for fun, we're just creating a very simple record.

78
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:20,256
Click on create.

79
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:23,930
Now, let's see if we can resolve that DNS directly

80
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,232
from our EC2 instances.

81
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:29,113
Let's go to our EC2 instance.

82
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:31,693
Here is one and I'll do a dig.

83
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:34,003
On fubar.internal.

84
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:35,571
Here we get the answer section

85
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:38,005
which is google.com as a CNAME.

86
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:39,017
This worked.

87
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:40,571
Now basically thanks to these settings,

88
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:44,238
we can have a private hosted zone in our VPC

89
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:47,604
which is really cool because now we can create a bunch

90
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:50,897
of records for domains we don't necessarily own

91
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,615
because this is a private zone.

92
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:54,677
This is accessible within our VPC.

93
00:03:54,677 --> 00:03:56,747
It is a very common exam question.

94
00:03:56,747 --> 00:03:59,289
When you do have private Route 53 zones.

95
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:01,121
I think no one shows you how to do this.

96
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:02,807
I wanted to show you how to do this right now.

97
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:05,853
This is how you would create a private zone on Route 53

98
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:08,890
and have it resolve within your VPC.

99
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,723
That's it.

100
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:10,905
I will see you in the next lecture.
