1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,500
So, let's go to the Route 53 console.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,700
And, as we can see here, that's a scalable DNS.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,370
So, Route 53 is a global service.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,470
It does not require any region selection.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,460
And then when you go to your hosted zones,

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,410
currently it shows a new AWS account for you.

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,460
You'll see nothing.

8
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,770
But for me, I already bought a purchase

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,040
and domain name and created a hosted zone from it.

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,980
So, we see stephanetheteacher.com.

11
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,130
So, let's go ahead, say we have nothing in it.

12
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,300
What you want to do is to purchase a domain.

13
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,630
So, for this, you go to Registered domains

14
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,920
and click on Register Domain.

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,620
And here you're able to choose a domain name,

16
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,790
so say whateveryouwantasadomainname.com.

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,190
Hopefully, that's available.

18
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,663
And it's available.

19
00:00:39,663 --> 00:00:41,810
So, okay, $12 per year,

20
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,690
so just know that it's going to be pricey.

21
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,610
Then you add to cart.

22
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,130
You say register for one year.

23
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,960
You scroll down, say continue.

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Then you put on all your information

25
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,260
and you should enable privacy protection

26
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,970
just to make sure that no one can know

27
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,230
what's your personal details.

28
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,810
So, you click on Enable here, which is by default.

29
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,700
Finally, you check your contact details.

30
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,440
You check the terms and conditions and say I agree,

31
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,710
and then finally, you click on Complete Purchase,

32
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,720
and it will go ahead and actually do the purchase.

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,553
Now, I'm not going to do it

34
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:11,120
because I already have a domain name.

35
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,140
Then it'll take about, maybe, an hour to get ready,

36
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,900
and then you can follow me along in this class.

37
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,480
After doing the request, it will be in Pending requests,

38
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,790
and you'll see it and you can see the status.

39
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,010
You'll receive some emails.

40
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,560
And then when you're all done,

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,020
it will be under Register Domain,

42
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,110
and you'll see the expiration date,

43
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,060
whether or not there is auto renew on, et cetera, et cetera.

44
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,893
All right.

45
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:30,800
So then you go to Hosted Zone,

46
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,470
and automatically because you purchased

47
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,670
a domain through Route 53,

48
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,070
then a hosted zone will be created for you.

49
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,270
And we can go ahead and click on it

50
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,180
and start creating some records.

51
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,500
So, currently, I do have some records created

52
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,030
for some of my applications, but don't worry about it.

53
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,720
Right now, you should only have two records.

54
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,340
And so what we'll do is that we'll create a record set,

55
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,960
and we'll create just a random record set.

56
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,643
We'll call it myfirstrecord.

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,410
And then we'll say A-IPv4 address,

58
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,310
and I'll say the value will be 11.22.33.44.

59
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,790
Just a very simple DNS record right here,

60
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,600
and click on create.

61
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,770
And here we go, it's been created.

62
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,510
And so now, basically, if I go on the internet

63
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,510
and look for this URL, myfirstrecord.stephanetheteacher.com,

64
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,200
I will be redirected in the back end

65
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,920
to this URL 11.22.33.44, this IPv4 address.

66
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,440
Now, obviously because I don't have any servers

67
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,460
at this address or anything like that,

68
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,040
it will not work, but you get the idea

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,160
of how these things work.

70
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,030
Now, how do we verify programmatically

71
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,980
that the DNS record of this thing actually points

72
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,290
to this IP is what I want to show you right now.

73
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,750
So, for this, we will go to the command line,

74
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,190
and if you're on Windows, it's called nslookup,

75
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,710
and you type the domain name.

76
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,420
So, my domain name here was

77
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,194
myfirstrecord.stephanetheteacher.com, so let's do it.

78
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:55,227
myfirstrecord.stephanetheteacher.com,

79
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,010
and this will give you something like this in Windows.

80
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,843
So, it tells you

81
00:03:01,843 --> 00:03:04,230
that myfirstrecord.stephanetheteacher.com resolves

82
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,940
to 11.22.33.44, which is excellent.

83
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,360
And if you're on Mac, and I'll use this because I'm

84
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,960
on Mac and I'm more familiar with dig command,

85
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,960
you type dig and then myfirstrecord.stephanetheteacher.com,

86
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,680
and it give you something similar,

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,460
just a little bit more information.

88
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,220
So, here we see from the answer section

89
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,710
that myfirstrecord.stephanetheteacher.com

90
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,710
is the same, 11.22.33.44.

91
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,260
So, you're free to use whatever command you want.

92
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,093
If you're on Windows, nslookup.

93
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:33,850
If you're on Mac, Linux, use dig.

94
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,080
It's whatever you want, really.

95
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,940
I like dig, so I'll just follow along with dig,

96
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,850
but you're free to just use whatever you want.

97
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,040
So, this is how we check that a DNS record works.

98
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,420
I will say we haven't achieved much here.

99
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,710
We just created a record pointing to an IP

100
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,150
that we don't control, so there's not much going on,

101
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,370
but we'll see in this lecture

102
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,450
how we can make things interesting with a Root 53 DNS

103
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,180
and some applications running in the background,

104
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,730
so see you in the next lecture.
