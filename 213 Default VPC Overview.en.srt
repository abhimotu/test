1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,179
<v Lecturer>So before we go ahead and start</v>

2
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:03,589
creating our own VPC,

3
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:06,994
I want us to walk through the default VPC that comes with

4
00:00:06,994 --> 00:00:10,200
all of our accounts when we create a new account in AWS.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,210
As soon as you create your account you get a default VPC.

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,139
If you have an old account,

7
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,869
there's a chance you don't have one so try to work

8
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:18,059
within your account if you don't have one.

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,490
New instances will be launched by default

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,680
into default VPC if you don't specify any subnets,

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,632
and the default VPC comes with Internet connectivity

12
00:00:26,632 --> 00:00:28,541
and all instances have public IP.

13
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,583
This is how we've been able so far to use our instances,

14
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,662
do YAML updates,

15
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:35,892
install APACHEE servers, etc., etc.

16
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:38,372
We also get a public and a private DNS

17
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,903
for each of our instances,

18
00:00:39,903 --> 00:00:41,372
and this you think is a given,

19
00:00:41,372 --> 00:00:44,221
but basically this was configured in the default VPC.

20
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:46,271
So now let's go and have a look at

21
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:48,831
what the default VPC looks like in AWS.

22
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:51,082
So my Management Console, I'm going to go ahead

23
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:53,415
and look at the VPC service.

24
00:00:54,843 --> 00:00:57,172
Now in this VPC service we have the Dashboard

25
00:00:57,172 --> 00:00:59,509
which shows the resources by region.

26
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:01,071
So as we see we have one VPC,

27
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:02,282
three subnets,

28
00:01:02,282 --> 00:01:03,229
one route table,

29
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,954
one Internet gateway,

30
00:01:04,954 --> 00:01:06,581
one DHCP options set,

31
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:07,854
one network ACL,

32
00:01:07,854 --> 00:01:09,135
and 12 security groups

33
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,703
because I credit many security groups.

34
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,954
So, all these things we see right here

35
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:15,174
are basically created by default for us when we

36
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:16,703
do have a new account.

37
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:17,983
We can just play around and create a new account

38
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:21,166
and see what is going to be there.

39
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,697
In the end, in this section, we're going to

40
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:24,406
create our own everything,

41
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:26,336
but for now it's good to look at the state

42
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,425
of what is already there just to get a small idea

43
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:30,057
of how things work.

44
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:30,890
If you click on Your VPCs, the first thing you see

45
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,890
is that we have a VPC right here that has been created,

46
00:01:36,303 --> 00:01:39,034
and this is the default VPC.

47
00:01:39,034 --> 00:01:41,261
It says here "Default VPC: Yes."

48
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:43,861
If you look at the Ipv4 CIDR, we see that

49
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:44,771
this is this CDIR.

50
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,354
So we are interested. We're intrigued.

51
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:48,234
We want to know what this CIDR is,

52
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,416
so we'll go to our website, calculate it,

53
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,836
and we see the first IP is this one,

54
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:53,699
and the last IP is this one,

55
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:57,449
and we get about 65 thousand IPs in this CIDR.

56
00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:59,470
Okay, so this is pretty good.

57
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,637
We have a VPC,

58
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:03,670
it has one Ipv4 CIDR block,

59
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,993
and there is no flow logs, there is no tags,

60
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,906
the description seems to say that there is

61
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:13,035
a network ACL, a Route table, DHCP options set, etc., etc.

62
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:15,686
So this looks like when we create a VPC we're defined

63
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:17,275
just a CIDR.

64
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,875
Now we go to subnets, and here we know we

65
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:23,575
can launch instances into three different availability zones

66
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:24,744
and into three different subnets,

67
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:25,735
so here they are.

68
00:02:25,735 --> 00:02:27,545
We have Subnet one, two, and three.

69
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:30,135
And these subnets have their own CIDR as well

70
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:32,152
so we can see that each subnet, for example,

71
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,975
if we take this one, it may be different for you,

72
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:36,724
but if we take this subnet,

73
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,474
and we calculate this CIDR,

74
00:02:38,474 --> 00:02:39,642
we can see that the first

75
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:41,135
instance IP is

76
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:42,135
172.31.32.0,

77
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:47,623
and the last one is 172.31.47.255.

78
00:02:47,623 --> 00:02:50,382
We get a total host of 4096,

79
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:53,904
but in here we get available IP 4091,

80
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:56,216
there's five IP of differences,

81
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:58,702
we'll see why in a future lecture.

82
00:02:58,702 --> 00:03:02,504
It looks like each subnet in there is basically

83
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:06,103
having a CIDR that is within the VPC CIDR,

84
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,096
and it looks like all these subnets have

85
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:10,455
a non overlapping CIDR.

86
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:13,074
Now, each of these subnets, we can look at it,

87
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:15,662
it belongs to the VPC we have available,

88
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,674
and we have no flow logs,

89
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:21,263
we have a Route Table, basically that is in this VPC

90
00:03:21,263 --> 00:03:24,622
and so we'll have a look at this Route Table in a second,

91
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:27,464
and then for Network ACLs, we get allow all traffic

92
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:30,274
as a Network ACL and allow all down traffics

93
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:32,973
it looks like all traffics is allowed in our VPC

94
00:03:32,973 --> 00:03:35,274
and your subnet, and then we're good.

95
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:36,924
Now if you look at Route Tables,

96
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:38,634
it looks like we have a Route Table,

97
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:40,613
there's only one of it, and it's a main route table,

98
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:43,144
it belongs to the default VPC,

99
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:45,845
and basically in terms of subnet association,

100
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,773
it's associated not explicitly,

101
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:50,253
but it is associated with these three subnets.

102
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:53,760
Look at the routes defined in this route table,

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,749
basically define how our subnets will get access

104
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:58,421
to the Internet.

105
00:03:58,421 --> 00:03:59,760
And if you look at the Internet,

106
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,140
it looks like one of these targets is an Internet Gateway.

107
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,220
So Internet Gateway is right here and

108
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,027
it's attached to the VPC,

109
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:09,549
and there's not much we can do with it,

110
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,930
but it looks like the Internet Gateway's

111
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,109
going to give us Internet.

112
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:16,250
So, that's all we need to see right here just to get started

113
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,480
but we look like a default VPC right now maybe we don't

114
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,760
understand anything we see and maybe we don't

115
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,593
understand what is route table,

116
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:23,426
where is Internet Gateway,

117
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:25,549
and don't worry, we'll do this one-by-one.

118
00:04:25,549 --> 00:04:28,530
But I want you to realize what a Default VPC comes with

119
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,170
before we go ahead and create our own VPC.

120
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,050
A Default VPC basically comes with a bunch of these

121
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,467
four little menus right here,

122
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,101
it comes with a VPC, three subnets, one route rable,

123
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:44,312
one Internet Gateway, and then one Network ACL list

124
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:47,541
that allows all inbound and all outbound.

125
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,952
We'll see in details what this means

126
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:49,810
and how this works,

127
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,541
but before we go ahead into the next lecture,

128
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,952
please have a look at the Default VPC.

129
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:56,842
Try playing around, try and see if it means anything to you,

130
00:04:56,842 --> 00:04:57,675
and I will see you

131
00:04:57,675 --> 00:04:59,375
in the next lecture to create our own VPC.
