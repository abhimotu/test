1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,013
<v Instructor>Now let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:01,013 --> 00:00:02,070
and create our own VPC.

3
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,760
So VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,120
and you can have multiple VPC in a region,

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,710
up to five of maximum.

6
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,730
But there's a soft limit,

7
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,220
so you can place an AWS support ticket

8
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,250
and then they will increase that limit for you.

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,320
And each VPC can have up to five CIDR.

10
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,260
For each CIDR, the minimum size must be slash 28,

11
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,420
so 16 IP addresses,

12
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,890
and the maximum size is slash 16,

13
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,760
so 65,536 IP addresses.

14
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,330
Because VPC is private,

15
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,410
only the private IP ranges are allowed.

16
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,890
So just as a reminder,

17
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,870
we get this range, 10.0.0.0/8,

18
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,830
we get this range, 172.16.0.0/12,

19
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,390
and then finally, the home network IP address,

20
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,000
so 192.168.0.0/16.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,610
And the really interesting thing is

22
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,620
that when you do create A VPC,

23
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,840
the CIDR you choose should not overlap

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,880
with your other networks.

25
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,070
For example, if you have a corporate network,

26
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,130
and you're on 172 dot something,

27
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,380
then make sure when you create a new VPC,

28
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,660
that there is no overlapping IP ranges

29
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,180
because when you start connecting all of those together,

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,013
you wanna make sure

31
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:09,000
that the IPs are not going to be overlapping.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,430
So there's enough IPs in this world

33
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,230
for you to choose non-overlapping CIDR,

34
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,930
just be very careful with it.

35
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,280
So if we look at the state of the Hands On,

36
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,770
this is what we'll have at the end.

37
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,450
Within the AWS cloud, we will have a VPC with nothing in it.

38
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,140
So lets' get started.

39
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,570
So the really easy way to get started with a VPC would be

40
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,820
to Launch VPC Wizard,

41
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,800
but then that would defeat the whole point of learning,

42
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,110
so we are going to create a VPC manually

43
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:31,943
without the wizard

44
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:33,500
and it's actually going to be better.

45
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,637
So we'll create a VPC

46
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:39,270
and for this, we'll go into Your VPCs, and Create VPC.

47
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,330
The nametag will be DemoVPC.

48
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,240
And here we have to choose an IPv4 CIDR block.

49
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,020
So for this, we'll choose 10.0.0.0/16.

50
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,610
That's the biggest IP CIDR block we can choose.

51
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,070
If we do slash 15,

52
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,490
there will be a problem because the block sizes must be

53
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,070
between slash 16 and slash 28.

54
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,250
So slash 16 is a great idea.

55
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,810
And if we wanna know what slash 16 means,

56
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,010
we can go back to our website, CIDR to IPv4 Conversion,

57
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,680
type in the CIDR, and we see

58
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,780
that the first IP is going to be 10.0.0.0 slash 0,

59
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,930
and then the last one is going to be 10.0.255.255.

60
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,510
So that's 65,000 IPs.

61
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,130
All right, great.

62
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,870
For now, we're not going to do IPv6,

63
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,220
so we'll leave no IPv6 CIDR block off.

64
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,440
And the tendency is, basically,

65
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,710
how we launch EC2 instances within it.

66
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,520
Do we want default, which means shared hardware,

67
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,040
or dedicated hardware?

68
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,650
And this one was inherited

69
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,690
by when you create an EC2 instance.

70
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,580
So we'll select Default,

71
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,020
we don't want to have dedicated hardware,

72
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,930
otherwise, we'll pay a whole lot more money.

73
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,763
Click on Create.

74
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,207
And our VPC has been created.

75
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,960
And if we look at our VPC,

76
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,700
it looks like there's one CIDR block

77
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,230
that has been defined.

78
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,980
So the CIDR block is right here,

79
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,320
Flow Logs, there is nothing,

80
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,780
Tags, there is nothing.

81
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,400
But it looks like when we created that DemoVPC,

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,770
it comes with a Main Route table

83
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,083
and a Main Network ACL that have been created for us.

84
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,530
So what can we look at this.

85
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,510
Well, the one thing I want you to notice is

86
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,990
that we're not limited to just this IPv4 CIDR block.

87
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,270
If you wanted to, you'd be able to edit your CIDRs,

88
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,420
by clicking on Edit CIDR.

89
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,950
And here, we're able to add IPv6 CIDR

90
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,180
if we wanted to later on or add IPv4 CIDR.

91
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,480
So if you wanted to add a CIDR for IPv4,

92
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,830
you could definitely do 10.1.0.0/16,

93
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,920
which is the next CIDR,

94
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,900
and then you click on Yes,

95
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,390
and it automatically would associate that.

96
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,580
So you can add up to five VPC IPv4 CIDR in there

97
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,380
to extend your VPC size over time.

98
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,863
For now, I don't need to add this one,

99
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:45,960
so I'll just remove it,

100
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,240
but I just wanted to show you how this were to work

101
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,863
if you wanted to add more CIDRs to your VPC.

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,980
So that's it, right now, we just have a VPC,

103
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,600
it's basically a big container.

104
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,390
We haven't defined any subnets, but guess what?

105
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,090
We'll do that in the next lecture.
